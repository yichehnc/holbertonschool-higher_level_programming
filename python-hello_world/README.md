### Description
First introduction to scripting in Python 3, and basic use of strings.

File(s): [`2-print.py`](./2-print.py)

Complete the provided source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.
* You are not allowed to cast the variable number into a string
* Your code must be 3 lines long
* You have to use the [new style](https://pyformat.info/#number) of printing numbers (with `.format(...)`)

File(s): [`3-print_number.py`](./3-print_number.py)

Complete the provided source code in order to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.
* The output of the program should be:
    * `Float:`, followed by the float with only 2 digits
    * followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to cast `number` to string
* You have to use the [new style](https://pyformat.info/#number) of printing numbers (with `.format(...)`)

File(s): [`4-print_float.py`](./4-print_float.py)

Complete the provided source code in order to print a string stored in the variable str 3 times, followed by its first 9 characters.
* The output of the program should be:
    * 3 times the value of `str`
    * followed by a new line
    * followed by the 9 first characters of `str`
    * followed by a new line
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
* Your program should be maximum 5 lines long

File(s): [`5-print_string.py`](./5-print_string.py)

Complete the provided source code to print `Welcome to Holberton School!`
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
* You have to use the variables `str1` and `str2` in your new line of code
* Your program should be exactly 5 lines long

File(s): [`6-concat.py`](./6-concat.py)

Complete the provided source code
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
* Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
* `word_first_3` should contain the first 3 letters of the variable `word`
* `word_last_2` should contain the last 2 letters of the variable `word`
* `middle_word` should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters

File(s): [`7-edges.py`](./7-edges.py)

Complete the provided source code to print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line.
* You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
* Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
* You are not allowed to create new variables
* You are not allowed to use string literals

File(s): [`8-concat_edges.py`](./8-concat_edges.py)

Write a Python script that prints “The Zen of Python”, by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.
* Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with `wc -m 9-easter_egg.py`)

File(s): [`9-easter_egg.py`](./9-easter_egg.py)

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
* Prototype: `int check_cycle(listint_t *list);`
* Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
